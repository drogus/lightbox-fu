Really simple lightbox. You can open lightbox with given dimensions and html. 

It's build to be fast and really light - all positioning is based on CSS (with some expressions hacks for IE6 and IE7).

Usage:
Initialize lightbox and give custom paths to images and stylesheets:

$.lightBoxFu.initialize({imagesPath: '/images/', stylesheetsPath: '/stylesheets/'});

Open lightbox with given html and width:

$.lightBoxFu.open({
        html: "Some <b>shiny</b> HTML.",
        width: "250px",
        /* don't let the user close lightBoxFu by clicking on an overlay */
	closeOnClick: false
      });
